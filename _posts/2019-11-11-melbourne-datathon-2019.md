## Summary
Sugarcane processing is a business with extremely right profit margina where large volumes of sugarcane must be processed efficiently in order to make a profit. Harvesting and processing of sugarcane can be impacted by factors such as adverse weather conditions and machinery breakdowns. Harvest and transport accounts for one-third of all on-farm costs, therefore any initiative to improve the efficiency of harvest activities would be very beneficial to the industry.

Sugarmills must schedule when sugarcane will be harvested from each farm while knowing how much cane will be transported to the mill since canes must be crushed within 16 hours of harvest. Using satellite imagery to predict and monitor sugarcane crop can cut operational costs.

The Sugar Rush app aims to:
* Identify when a crop on a farm will become available to be harvested
* Provide rough estimates of crop yield
* Allow the progress of a crop to be compared to the same point in previous seasons

The first two focus areas are vital to ensure efficient harvest activities and protect profit margins from weather events and equipment breakdowns. The third area may allow farmers to intervene if a crop is not progressing as expected allowing them to maximise harvest yield to the benefit of both themselves and the sugar mills.
