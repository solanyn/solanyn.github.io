## Summary
The aim of this project aims to research and develop a product to meet a requirement within competitive and casual cycling community which is not currently addressed by the existing market.

Small scale events do not currently have an accurate and affordable means of timing participants or easily providing this information to participants, coaches and spectators.

Current UHF RFID is expensive and requires technical knowledge to operate and is not portable.

The GitHub [repository](https://github.com/solanyn/speedway-tag-read) demonstrates a minimum viable product of which the hardware requirements of a portable, scalable and cheaper product will be based off.

The project is currently exploring embedded UHF readers which provide long range RFID tag reading (up to 10m) and the development of an embedded system to achieve portability and scalability of accurate RFID tag reading.
