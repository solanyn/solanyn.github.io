I am a current Master of Data Science student at RMIT University. I will be graduating at the end of 2020.

I am currently participating in the Melbourne Datathon 2019 Data2App category where my team and I are building a tool to help sugarcane farmers schedule harvests using satellite imagery.

I'm currently looking for internships and graduate roles in a data science position.
